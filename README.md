# About
This website was created as a volunteer project for the parent-teacher organization of my former middle school. The project was worked on during the late winter and early spring of 2020. I was a high school freshmen at the time.

The goal of this website was to create a virtual "cultural night", where users (other students) could share their ideas, passions, and traditions of their own cultures with other students. This event is normally held in person, however it could not be held during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The website allowed users to:
- Login using their google accounts.
- Upload photos.
- Upload videos.
- Upload/write text documents.
- View others posts.

It also had several moderation features including:
- Post deleting.
- Account banning.
- Live error reporting.

The project ended in May of 2020, and it has not been updated since. In addition, the live site is no longer running.

The code for it is a bit messy, but I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish considering it was during a time where HTML, PHP, CSS, and JS were all still very new to me.
